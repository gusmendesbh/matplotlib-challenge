# Background

Pymaceuticals, Inc., a new pharmaceutical company that specializes in anti-cancer medications, recently began screening for potential treatments for squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), a commonly occurring form of skin cancer.

This document analyze complete data from their most recent animal study, where 249 mice who were identified with SCC tumors received treatment with a range of drug regimens, over the course of 45 days. Tumor development was observed and measured. The purpose of this study was to compare the performance of Pymaceuticalsâ€™ drug of interest, Capomulin, against the other treatment regimens.

- The tumor volume on mice on Capomulin and Ramicane regiments at the end of the treatment is significantly smaller than other regiments observed.

- On Capomulin regiment, notice a considerable drop in average tumor volume after twenty days of treatment, and a slight uptick at around 40 days of treatment.

- The correlation between mouse weight and the average tumor volume is 0.84, which makes it a strong correlation.
